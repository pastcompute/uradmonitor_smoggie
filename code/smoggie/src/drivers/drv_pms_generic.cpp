 *  Project:    SMOGGIE is an ultra-low cost automated air quality monitor with a rain proof enclosure and a simple mount system to make installation easy. 
 *  			It features a high quality laser scatering Particulate Matter sensor for PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 and an additional sensor for temperature, pressure and humidity. 
 *  			It connects to the internet via Wifi and can be powered by a standard 5V micro-usb cable. Readings are accessed via the uRADMonitor API or decentralized via your local network. This monitor is lab tested for data accuracy.
